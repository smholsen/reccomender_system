# Before we continue with the filtering of our datasets, we need to do some additional pre processing.
# From what I gather, SciKit Learn's cross validation library only accepts numeric values,
# even for their ID fields.
# I guess I believe this is because it wants to be as generic as possible but I am not sure.
# Now, this seems weird, so I am not sure, but this is what I found,
# and after trials and fails I propose we do the following:
# We can run through the sets before we do the actual filtering and encode each userID and articleID to numeric values.
# I suggest that this is better than doing it while we are doing the actual filtering as it will greatly reduce
# the space complexity, and I think this is a fair tradeoff for the insignificant added time complexity.
# We can use this for the encoding:
